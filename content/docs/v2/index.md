## Middleware

Several hooks are already included in the Chihaya repository.

### Interval Variation

The `interval variation` PreHook adds variation to the announce interval.
Find more info in [the documentation](/docs/v2/middleware/varinterval/).

### Plausible Deniability

The `deniability` PreHook adds ghost peers into announce responses and randomly increases scrape counters to achieve plausible deniability.
Find more info in [the documentation](/docs/v2/middleware/deniability/).
